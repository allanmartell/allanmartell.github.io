	<h1>Allan A. Martell</h1>
	
	<h2>I'm in the job market</h2>
	
	<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information at the University of Michigan (UMSI). I expect to graduate in the summer of 2020. <a href="/about">You can read my bio here.</a></p>
	<p>My research lies at the intersection of social memory, science and technology studies, museum studies and interactions design. Throughout the course of my doctoral studies in information science at the University of Michigan, I have been exploring: </p>
		<ul>
			<il>1) how design decisions shape the way that people remember the recent violent past, and<br/> </il>
			<il>2) how to re-orient the design process to support critical, nuanced interpretations of that past.</il>
		</ul>
	
	<p>My dissertation: “Memory labor as memory-making: museum exhibition design as a mediation of memory,” examines the role of participatory museum exhibition design in reframing the memories of children of former war refugees.</p> 
	<p>I argue that exhibition design can serve to intervene in post-conflict contexts. Specifically, my findings indicate that participation in the design process leads children of former war refugees to gradually shift their memories. This occurs because design enables these children a sustained and interactive experience of deeply reflecting about their own memories while also engaging with similar recollections from like-minded peers and forces them to create tangible and public representations of their own memories. </p>
