	<h1>Allan A. Martell</h1>

	<h2>I'm in the job market</h2>

	<p>I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Library and Information Science at Louisiana State University. <a href="/about">You can read my bio here.</a></p>
	<p>My research lies at the intersection of interactions design, memory studies, and museum studies. In my work, I explore: </p>
		<ul class="researchthemes">
			<il class="theme">1) how design decisions shape the way that people remember the recent violent past, and<br> </il>
			<il class="theme">2) how to re-orient the design process to support critical, nuanced interpretations of that past.<br></il>
			<il class="theme">3) how to re-orient the design process to engender empathy towards the victims of past violence.</il>
		</ul>

	<p>My dissertation: “Memory labor as memory-making: museum exhibition design as a mediation of memory,” examines the role of participatory museum exhibition design in reframing the memories of children of former war refugees.</p>
	<p>I argue that exhibition design can serve to intervene in post-conflict contexts. Specifically, my findings indicate that participation in the design process leads grandchildren of former war refugees to remember differently. This occurs because design enables these children a sustained and interactive experience of deeply reflecting about their own memories while also engaging with similar recollections from like-minded peers and forces them to create tangible and public representations of their own memories. </p>
