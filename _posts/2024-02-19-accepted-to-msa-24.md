Today, I received confirmation that my paper "Social Memory Infrastructures: Pushing the Boundaries of Resources, Policies, and Institutions to Support Memory Activism" has been accepted to the 2024 annual meeting of the Memory Studies Association, titled "Memories in Transit."

The conference will be held at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú to be held in Lima from 18-20 July 2024.

The paper I'll be presenting is based on data that I collected during my dissertation fieldwork back in 2018, though I have not had the opportunity to share it publicly yet.
