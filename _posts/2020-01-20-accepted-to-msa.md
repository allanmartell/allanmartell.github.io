I recently received confirmation form the Memory Studies Association that the panel proposal of which I'm a member was accepted. This means I will be presenting in Charlottesville, Virginia in the summer about my dissertation research. Last year, during the 2019 conference I had presented the portion of my work that pertained to the contribution of design to memory mediation. Now, I will be presenting on the chapter that deals with cultural trauma.
