<h2 id="second-heading-">CGI during my spare time</h2>
<h2 id="Date-2020-04-17">Date: 2020-04-01</h2>
<p>I’ve been doing trying the tutorials from <em><a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/">The Nature of Code</a></em> by <a href="https://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>.</p>

<p>I fell in love with Computer-Generated Graphics (CGI) during my masters in Digital Media at Georgia Tech. In fact, I first learned to program in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. However, outside of the programming courses I teach at Michigan, I’ve not had much time to actually dive into CGI after I finished my masters. It’s been eight years and I wanted to hone my skills. So, I took advantage of my social distancing time productively.</p>

<p>I first started to adapt scripts from the processing tutorials into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygame</code> on my own. However, I quickly realized this was not getting me far. For once, I was just translating code from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Java</code> (processing is after all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Java</code>). I felt like I was translating a math paper from English to Spanish. Sure, I could make every sentence syntactically and grammatically correct, but this was not helping me grasp the argument, or in this case, the logic underpinning the commands. Thus, I decided to go back to the origins. I learned that Shiffman had an online version of his book and grabbed onto it.</p>

<p>It probably would be much faster if I just followed the instructions with Processing, but that’s too easy. More importantly, Processing is explicitly designed to abstract away the heavy lifting of setting up the environment for CGI. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pygame</code> does the same to an extent, but much lesser. If I want, for instance, to instantiate a Euclidean vector object in python, there is no built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PVector</code> class. I have to search for vector classes, and sometimes still extend them with additional functionality of my own. In so doing, I’m making sure I master the ins and outs of python syntax structure, and getting a healthy reminder about basic trigonometry and physics. These learning outcomes will help me in the future, if I want to write a CGI script in a different language.</p>

<p>In the mid-term, my hope is to use my learning to extend available options for information visualization through other python libraries like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code>. If I get away with this, I can actually link my current experiments with my plans to combine data-driven storytelling and my dissertation research on social memory. The way is long, but I’m not in a rush. After all, the priority right now is my dissertation. The good thing about CGI is that I find it so absorbing that it completely takes my mind out of my research-related concerns at the end of the day. So, I deepen my skills as a programmer, learn new ways to generate graphics, decompress, and make cool graphics. Thanks, Daniel Shiffman!</p>

<p>If you want to check out the scripts I’m producing, stop by my <a href="https://github.com/allanmartell/Nature-of-Code-with-Pygame">repo</a> here. I would love feedback to make better scripts.</p>

<p>Here is the very first script of this experiment, the classic <em><a href="https://github.com/allanmartell/Nature-of-Code-with-Pygame/raw/documentation/01%20-%20Vectors/1.1_bouncing_ball_with_vectors.py">bouncing ball</a></em>:</p>
